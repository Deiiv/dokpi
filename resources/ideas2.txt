Souls for Dokpi
Dokpi's Souls
Dokpi, the soul someshit

>You awake in an unknown land, where anyone you encounter is terrified of dokpi, telling stories about his greed for souls
You obtain a soul capturing device (dunno wut yet) which allows you to harvest souls from plants and animals and nearly anything
You do jobs for higher order folk who tell you they pay a share to dokpi
Find out they rip you off, kill their families, decide to go find the truth about dokpi by talking to it<

	iii) players/animals (array of ID(player or type of animal for drawing) and their droppable inventory
